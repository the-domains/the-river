Dance Is Contagious

Dance is a term causes the most traditional of church members to shudder and the most liberal to, well, dance. The act of dancing is interspersed throughout the Holy Scriptures and for good reason.  

In it's simplest description it is the act of worship to the one true and living God, Jesus Christ.  It is also an art form that is good art whether it is done in simplistic fashion or with great pomp and circumstance.  The key to this art form is to determine who you are dancing for.
